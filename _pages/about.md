My name is Anqi Zhang, Ph.D. in Linguistics. I am currently working as an Assistant Professor at the School of Liberal Arts, Nanjing University. 

I received  my Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics and in Egyptology from Brown University, and joined Phi Beta Kappa in my third year. I continued to receive my Ph.D. and worked as a Humanities Teaching Fellow lecturer for a year at the University of Chicago. 

My main research interests include semantics of aspects, verbs and degree from a cross-linguistic perspective. I have published various papers in international conference proceedings and journals and currently hold one grant from the National Social Science Fund of China.
